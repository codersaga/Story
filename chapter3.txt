THE SUMMER

As the days flying by people started dying. No food nothing. Only water that smells like a rotten meat.

Rains have stopped, but the fields were completely destroyed. Became unusable.

One fine day, the day itself has some magic in it. The same feel felt by our little hero Charan. He started walking east as the sun slowly started raising. As he went far away from village, he saw something that which only can be called as Wonder.
