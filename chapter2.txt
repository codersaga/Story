HOPE AND DESPAIR

All hope lost. The villagers started to leave the village and headed toward cities. No one knew the path they were taking leads directly to hell.

As the days passing the pile of bodies started to increase. All the dead bodies from higher areas of river Krishna are appearing in the village. They didn't know what to do with them. They tried burning but no use, they don't caught fire.

With lots of efforts they dig deep under the flooded water and buried the bodies.
