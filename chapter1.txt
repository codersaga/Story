Once upon a time there was an old village known as Amarachintha near river Krishna. With alot of fields surrounding the village it was famously known as 'The Garden'.

Every human being living there was a kind soul. For many years the village was prosporous and wealthy. But nature has some other plans. In one rainy season, The rains were so high that the river krishna flodded all the villages near it, and Amarachintha too flooded.
